server actions : functions that run on the server, but can be called like normal functions 
use the use server flag 
under the nextjs code implementation, whatever we write inside a function with the use server flag turn into an api with post method.

Why? 
    less code 
    we focus on logic rather than code.
    we dont have to create the api ourself, nextjs will handle it automatically for us.
    ( could be a problem : we dont have any control over it. )
    less client side code -> faster load and respond better. better seo, web vitals, crawl budget, crawl ranking.
    fater code ship

server actions allow you to do mutations
